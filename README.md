# Comparison of the performances of Newton method and Inexact Newton method on a large-scale problem

In this works we present our MATLAB implementation of the Pure Newton method and Inexact newton method with line 
search. We test them on an unconstrained optimization problem and we compare their results through variouis graphs.
